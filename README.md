working on local-device guide->

requred knowlegde-Google OAuth and Nextjs

1>setup google console of Oauth
2>create a .env.local file 
3>setup with the folowing 

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=[your google cleint id]
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=[your google client secret ]
AUTH_SECRET=[generate by authjs]


## chalenges 
1>setting up Google OAuth - very difficult to even navigate on google console as first time doing , if it would have been github this project would be breeze
2>Next-Auth - difficult to read  documentation , i have to rely on youtube video to figure this out 
3>use client and server - i am very new to Next js and always get server and client error but this project teaches me alot 

## Improvements->

1->I can design and comeup with even better UI 
2->Adding responsiveness
3->adding more funtionality for fun
